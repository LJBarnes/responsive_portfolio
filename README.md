# responsive_portfolio
My personal portfolio created with Bootstrap classes.

I created this portfolio to showcase my projects, tell a little about myself, and provide contact information for potential employers and clients. Basing this portfolio off of a basic portfolio I previously created with HTML and CSS, I used Bootstrap classes to make the pages and images therein responsive to different screen sizes. 

Feel free to take a look at my code and contact me with any questions or inquiries.
